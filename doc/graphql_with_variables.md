## calling graphql statements with JSON variables

Much nicer than the hard coded data. Much easier to implement on the client.

### CURL

```
curl -s \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST \
     localhost:8080/graphql \
     --data '@examples/with_variables.graphql' \
| jq .data
```

> Warning: The content type MUST be `application/json`!

The variables are then provided as a JSON object as such: 

```json
{
    "query": "mutation addSdgMatch($matcher: [AddSdgMatchInput!]!) { addSdgMatch(input: $matcher) { sdgMatch { construct } } }",
    "variables": {
        "matcher":[ 
            {
              "construct": "sdg16_c86_de",
              "language": "de",
              "keyword": "Freiheit der Rede",
              "required_context": ""
            },
            {
              "construct": "sdg16_c86_fr",
              "language": "fr",
              "keyword": "libert√© d'expression",
              "required_context": ""
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

For initialising the variables the `add`-operation must be provided, twice. 

The first (outer) operation assigns the *operation input*. During this step it is necessary for assigning the correct variable *input type* to the operation. The correct input type is constructed by capitalising the operation and add `Input` as suffix. In the given example the operation is `addSdgMatch`. Therefore, the input type is `AddSdgMatchInput`. 

The second (inner) part of the operation uses the variable as input. Note that the variable must be prefixed *perl4*/*php*-style with a dollar sign. The dollar sign MUST be absent in the variable declaration in the `variables`-part.
